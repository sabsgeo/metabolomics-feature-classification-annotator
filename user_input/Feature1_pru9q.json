{"name":"Feature1.png","classification":"Bad","description":"1) RT is low so probably starting of a elution\n2) S/N ratio seems to be good on one side, but not on the other\n3) intensity is also in the lower range. \n4) overall there is an overlap between the two samples' peaks. If the threshold is relaxed for the peak integration, the peak would become widespread and not be considered as good peak.","audio":null}
